<p style="color:white">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Hammerplay we offer an extremely friendly and  a super casual working environment – something we truly believe in. Every member here shares a deep passion for video games, art and tech and that really shows in our daily work. Our work-space betters collaboration since the entire development team is in one large space, which keeps everyone completely accessible. We have setup a cosy studio where aside work one can play console games, take a nap in our bunk bed room, fire a movie or VR game in our in-house mini theater, play ping pong,even do a 3D print of a model or simply kick back in the couch. There’s always enough to have fun at Hammerplay.

This welcoming atmosphere doesn’t stop at the Studio doors either. We regularly get together for a variety of Inhouse events, including monthly ‘All Night’ LAN gaming and Game Jams. We also have regular company events, including Birthday parties which is fondly called as “Treats’ at the Studio.

Finally, at Hammerplay we only look at offering careers and not just another job to put on resumes. We ensure that everyone here is the given the required resources to grow based on their abilities and interests.</p><br>
